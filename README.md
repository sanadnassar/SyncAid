## SyncAid
SyncAid is an AI-powered healthcare triage and scheduling platform designed to prevent missed appointments, prioritize high-risk patients, and dynamically adapt clinic schedules in real time. By combining predictive modeling, environmental data, and patient vulnerability signals, SyncAid transforms traditional reactive scheduling into a proactive care system.

## Why SyncAid exists
Missed and delayed appointments are not just an inconvenience, they lead to worse outcomes, higher emergency costs, and overworked healthcare staff. Traditional scheduling systems treat all appointments the same and only respond after a patient fails to show up.

This creates a vicious cycle: delays make patients sicker, care becomes more complex, and resources are stretched even thinner.

SyncAid breaks that cycle.

## What SyncAid does
SyncAid introduces risk-adaptive scheduling, a proactive system that continuously evaluates appointment risk and adjusts schedules to protect both patients and providers.

At a high level, SyncAid:
- Predicts which appointments are likely to be missed
- Identifies patients who would be most harmed by delays
- Dynamically reshuffles schedules with patient consent
- Triggers emergency transportation when access is at risk

## Core Features
— AI-powered risk scoring
Every appointment receives a score from 0–100 based on:
- Past no-shows and cancellations
- Weather forecasts and road conditions
- Transportation reliability
- Patient medical vulnerability
- Confirmation behavior (unconfirmed appointments raise risk quickly)

— Dynamic appointment swapping
If an appointment is likely to be missed:
- The slot can be reassigned to a high-priority standby patient
- The original patient is proactively moved to a protected priority slot
- All changes require explicit patient confirmation

— Emergency shuttle protocol
For medically fragile patients facing environmental barriers:
- Transportation is automatically scheduled
- Budget is allocated programmatically
- Patients and emergency contacts are notified
- Temporary care hubs can be used when necessary

— Nurse-first dashboard
Designed around how care teams actually work:
- Smart calendar with color-coded risk indicators
- Real-time action suggestions (swap, telehealth, transport)
- Patient list sorted by risk and urgency, not alphabetically

— Patient-friendly experience
Built for accessibility and trust:
- SMS-based communication 
- High-contrast, text-first design for seniors
- Automated reminders and confirmations
- Emergency contact escalation if responses are missed

## How it works
- Appointment data is ingested into the system
- AI models generate reliability and clinical priority scores
- Weather and transportation data continuously update risk
- Nurses receive real-time recommendations via the dashboard
- Patients are contacted for confirmation before any changes
- Emergency workflows activate only when strict thresholds are met
